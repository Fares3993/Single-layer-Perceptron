# Single layer Perceptron

Developed a single-layer perceptron from scratch to perform multi-class classification on the penguins dataset. Created an intuitive GUI allowing users to choose two features from body_mass_g, gender, flipper_length_mm, and bill_depth_mm, and select two classes from Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. Additionally, users can set the number of epochs, learning rate, and choose to include or exclude bias. The GUI offers a "TestGraph" button to visualize data points for each class separated by lines and displays a confusion matrix for evaluating model performance. This project showcases proficiency in machine learning, data visualization, and GUI development.
